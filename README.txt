How to run the program in the terminal:

javac HuffmanSubmit.java
java HuffmanSubmit

How the code works:

The objective of this program is to receive an input file, whether .pdf, .jpg, .txt, or anything, and encode that file using Huffman coding. Once an encoded version of the input file and a frequency txt file has been created, those two elements can then be used to decode the encoded file. The frequency txt file is especially important in storing information about each character's frequency, which will then be used in a Priority Queue.
